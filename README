create a directory with 'mkdir -p WindowsXPsounds'
put the mod.json and logo.png in there
do 'mkdir src resources' in the WindowsXPsounds folder
put the main.cpp in the src folder
put the .mp3 files in the resources folder
and go compile it into a geode mod using 'geode package build' or maybe it was 'geods build package'? I don't remember and then go manually install it
I don't care if it should be pre-compiled like other geode mods I'm in android making this what u want me to do? remake all of termux?
